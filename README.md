## What I Do

* Design and build scalable **microservices and APIs**
* **Event-driven pipelines** (AWS SQS/SNS), **caching** (Redis), **search** (Elasticsearch)
* **AI integrations** using LangChain and OpenAI API (RAG pipelines, prompt systems, automation)
* **Performance engineering** — latency, throughput, error reduction, and profiling
* **Cloud & DevOps** — AWS, Azure AKS, Docker, CI/CD, observability (Prometheus, Grafana)

---

## Proven Impact

* Average latency: ~600 ms → **194 ms** (−68%)
* P99 latency: 3.6 s → **446 ms** (−88%)
* 5xx errors: **4% → 0.1%** (−97.5%)
* AI cost: **−80%** (caching & prompt optimization)
* Auth overhead: **−95%** with token caching

## Selected Case Studies

### Freight Quotation Microservice (Enterprise Platform)

Refactored a mission-critical freight domain into a clean, isolated CRUD service.
**Results:** latency −68%, errors −97.5%, throughput +40%.

### Enterprise Freight Cost API (Go-based)

Contributed to refactoring, improved logs and traceability, and added minute-level quotation granularity.

### Brazilian Companies Data API (Personal Project)

High-performance API with PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis caching, and enrichment via external data sources.
**Result:** ~95% cache hit rate, sub-second responses.

### AI-Powered Legal Document Automation

RAG-based pipeline using LangChain and OpenAI for legal petition generation.
**Results:** 10× faster document prep, 80% lower inference cost.

### WhatsApp → AI Assistant Gateway

Event-driven architecture with BullMQ, Redis, and Auth0.
**Results:** −95% auth overhead; horizontally scalable design.

### Customer Reputation Insights Platform

AI-powered analytics for customer complaint categorization and sentiment insights.
**Results:** 90% less manual analysis time; 10k+ documents processed.

## Engineering Philosophy

* **Measure before optimizing** - data-driven performance work
* **Design for failure** - retries, backpressure, idempotency
* **Build for observability** - logs, metrics, and tracing by default
* **Optimize for ROI** - performance and efficiency in balance
