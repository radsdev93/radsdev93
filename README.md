## What I Do

* Build and scale **high-traffic microservices and APIs**.
* **Event-driven pipelines** (AWS SQS/SNS), **caching** (Redis), and **search** (Elasticsearch).
* **Applied AI integration** with LangChain and OpenAI API for RAG and automation, not model training.
* **Performance engineering**: latency, throughput, error rate, and profiling.
* **Cloud and DevOps**: AWS, Azure AKS, Docker, CI/CD, observability (Prometheus, Grafana).

## Proven Impact

* Average latency: about 600 ms to **194 ms (68% lower)**
* p99 latency: 3.6 s to **446 ms (88% lower)**
* 5xx errors: **4% to 0.1% (97.5% lower)**
* LLM API cost: **up to 80% lower** (caching + prompt strategy + RAG)
* Auth overhead: **95% lower** with token caching

## Selected Case Studies

### Freight Quotation Microservice (Enterprise Platform)

Refactored a mission-critical freight domain into a clean, isolated service.  
**Results:** **68% lower latency**, **97.5% fewer errors**, **40% higher throughput**.  
**Stack:** Node.js (TS), Redis, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Docker/Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana.

### Enterprise Freight Cost API (Go-based)

Improved logs and traceability and enabled minute-level quotation granularity.  
**Focus:** reliability, observability, and data correctness across services.

### Brazilian Companies Data API (Personal Project)

High-performance REST API with PostgreSQL/MySQL and Redis caching.  
**Result:** about **95%** cache hit rate and **sub-second** responses.  
**Repo/Docs:** on request (public endpoints and rate limits documented).

### Legal Document Automation

RAG pipeline using LangChain and OpenAI for petition generation.  
**Results:** **10x** faster document prep, **80% lower** inference cost.  
**Focus:** prompt strategy, retrieval quality, and cost controls.

### WhatsApp to AI Assistant Gateway

Event-driven architecture with BullMQ, Redis, and Auth0.  
**Results:** **95% lower** auth overhead and horizontally scalable design.

### Customer Reputation Insights Platform

Applied NLP for complaint categorization and sentiment.  
**Results:** **90% less** manual analysis time and **10k+** documents processed.

## Core Tech

**Languages and Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript/JavaScript), PHP (Laravel)  
**Messaging and Data:** AWS SQS/SNS, Redis, Elasticsearch, MySQL/PostgreSQL  
**Applied AI:** LangChain, OpenAI API, RAG, prompt engineering, cost optimization  
**Cloud and Ops:** AWS, Azure AKS, Docker, CI/CD, FluxCD, Prometheus, Grafana  
**Testing and Quality:** Jest, k6, OpenAPI/AsyncAPI, tracing and logging by default

## Engineering Principles

* **Measure before optimizing** - data-driven performance work.
* **Design for failure** - retries, backpressure, idempotency.
* **Build for observability** - logs, metrics, tracing by default.
* **Optimize for ROI** - performance and efficiency in balance.
